# High Level Architecture

This section defines the overall architectural strategy for the application.

* **Technical Summary**
    The AI Academic Assistant will be a full-stack, serverless web application built with a Jamstack architecture for optimal performance and scalability. The system will feature a type-safe API layer built with serverless functions. The frontend will be a responsive Next.js application, and the backend will be powered by Supabase for the database, authentication, and file storage. The entire project will be housed in a monorepo to ensure code consistency and type safety across the stack.

* **Platform and Infrastructure Choice**
    * **Platform:** **Vercel & Supabase**
    * **Key Services:**
        * **Vercel:** Hosting for the Next.js application, CI/CD, and execution of serverless functions for the API layer.
        * **Supabase:** Postgres database, user authentication, and object storage for syllabus file uploads.
    * **Deployment Host and Regions:** Vercel (Global Edge Network), Supabase (e.g., US-West).

* **Repository Structure**
    * **Structure:** **Monorepo**
    * **Monorepo Tool:** We will use the structure provided by the starter template, likely managed with npm/pnpm workspaces.
    * **Package Organization:** The monorepo will contain separate packages for the web application and any shared code (like data types).

        D --> G(Supabase Storage);
    ```

* **Architectural Patterns**
    * **Jamstack Architecture:** Delivers a pre-rendered static frontend for speed, enhanced with dynamic serverless functions.
    * **Full-stack Type Safety:** TypeScript types will be shared between the frontend and backend within the monorepo, preventing entire classes of bugs at the API boundary.
    * **Component-Based UI:** Leveraging React/Next.js to build a modular and maintainable user interface.
    * **Serverless Functions:** The API will be a collection of serverless functions, ensuring automatic scaling and cost-efficiency.
