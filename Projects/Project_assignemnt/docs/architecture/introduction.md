# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the AI Academic Assistant, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

* **Starter Template or Existing Project**
    * **Decision:** The project will be initialized using a production-grade starter template, such as the **T3 Stack** or a similar Vercel template.
    * **Rationale:** This provides a pre-configured, best-practices foundation for our chosen stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase) and monorepo structure. It handles the complex tooling and setup, allowing development to focus immediately on building features.
