# Section 1: Goals and Background Context

**1. Goals**

* To create a centralized, intelligent system for managing all academic assignments for an undergraduate student.
* To reduce the cognitive load of academic planning and organization.
* To improve productivity by providing perfectly crafted prompts to help complete assignments.
* To implement a cost-saving workflow by generating optimized prompts for external LLMs.
* To develop a robust multi-agent system with an intuitive web UI.

**2. Background Context**
The AI Academic Assistant is a full-stack web application designed to serve as a personal task management system for a college student. The system will leverage a team of specialized AI agents to streamline the academic workflow, from ingesting syllabi and organizing deadlines to breaking down complex assignments into manageable steps. The core innovation lies in its cost-effective approach: instead of performing computationally expensive tasks itself, the system's final output will be highly-optimized, structured prompts. The user can then execute these prompts in a frontier large language model (LLM) they already have access to, minimizing direct API costs while still benefiting from top-tier AI capabilities.
