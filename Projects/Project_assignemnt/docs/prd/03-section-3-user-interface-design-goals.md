# Section 3: User Interface Design Goals

**1. Overall UX Vision**
The application's user experience should be minimalist, professional, and intuitive. The design will prioritize clarity and efficiency, enabling students to manage their academic workflow with minimal friction. The interface will feel calm and organized, drawing inspiration from modern productivity tools like Notion to create a focused and empowering environment.

**2. Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Centralized Dashboard:** A main view will present all assignments in a clear, chronological list of what is due next.
* **Select-then-Act:** Users will select an item (like an assignment) and then be presented with contextual actions (like "Generate Plan").
* **Chat-based Refinement:** For complex AI interactions like planning, users will be able to refine AI suggestions through a simple, conversational chat interface.

**3. Core Screens and Views**

* **Login & Registration Page:** Standard email/password authentication screens.
* **Dashboard View:** The main screen after login, displaying the user's upcoming assignments and controls for adding new assignments and managing classes.
* **Syllabus Upload Page/Modal:** A dedicated interface for selecting a class and then uploading or pasting a syllabus for parsing.
* **Assignment Plan View:** A dedicated view for an assignment where a user submits instructions and interacts with the Task Breakdown Agent.
* **User Settings Page:** A basic page for account management.

**4. Accessibility**

* **Target:** The application will aim to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

**5. Branding**

* **Initial Plan:** Branding elements are to be determined. The initial design will use a clean, neutral palette.

**6. Target Platforms**

* **Primary:** A responsive web application accessible on modern desktop and mobile browsers.
