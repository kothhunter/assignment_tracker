```

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
Key interfaces that will need to be supported:
- `UserProfile`: Basic user data linked to auth.users
- `Class`: User's course management
- `Assignment`: Assignment tracking with status
- `AssignmentPlan`: AI-generated task breakdown

### Database Schema Foundation
[Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql-ddl.md]
Required database tables:
- `public.user_profiles` (linked to auth.users)
- `public.classes` (user's courses)
- `public.assignments` (with assignment_status enum)
- Custom enum: `assignment_status` ('incomplete' | 'complete')

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
tRPC router structure to implement:
- `classRouter`: Class management endpoints
- `assignmentRouter`: Assignment CRUD operations
- `aiRouter`: AI-powered parsing and planning
- Main `appRouter` combining all routers

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/frontend-backend-architecture-patterns.md]
- **Frontend**: Components in src/components/{ui,layout,features}, Zustand stores in src/stores, Next.js App Router in src/app
- **Backend**: Serverless functions as tRPC routers in src/server/api/routers, protectedProcedure middleware for auth

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure:
- Supabase config: `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- tRPC setup: `src/server/api/root.ts`, `src/server/api/trpc.ts`
- Global styles: `src/styles/globals.css`
- Type definitions: `src/types/`
- Components: `src/components/`

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript must be used throughout for type safety
- All API calls must use tRPC for type safety
- Authentication must use Supabase Auth
- Styling must use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Must be deployable to Vercel platform

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library
- E2E tests: Playwright
- Test files should follow Next.js testing conventions
- Tests should cover authentication flows and API endpoints

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Test Frameworks**: Jest ~29.x for unit testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library for React components
- **API Testing**: Test tRPC procedures with mock data
- **File Locations**: Tests should be co-located with source files or in __tests__ directories
- **Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of authentication flows and core functionality

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT**
The project initialization has been implemented with high quality. The developer followed all architectural patterns and requirements from the Dev Notes precisely. The codebase demonstrates proper TypeScript usage, modern Next.js patterns, and correct tRPC/Supabase integration. The project structure adheres to the unified project structure specification, and all major technical requirements are met.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: src/server/api/trpc.ts
- **Change**: Enhanced tRPC context to properly integrate with Supabase authentication using server-side cookies
- **Why**: The original implementation had a placeholder context that didn't handle actual authentication state
- **How**: Added proper Supabase server client creation with cookie handling, error boundaries, and graceful fallbacks for development environments

**File**: src/middleware.ts  
- **Change**: Improved authentication middleware with comprehensive error handling and redirect logic
- **Why**: Original middleware lacked proper error handling and had basic redirect logic
- **How**: Added try-catch blocks, proper error logging, protected route definitions, redirect URL preservation, and corrupted cookie cleanup

**File**: src/lib/trpc.ts
- **Change**: Renamed tRPC client export from `trpc` to `api` to avoid naming conflicts
- **Why**: There was a duplicate export between trpc.ts and trpc-provider.tsx causing potential confusion
- **How**: Changed export name to follow common convention and prevent naming collisions

**File**: src/lib/errors.ts (NEW)
- **Change**: Created comprehensive error handling utilities for tRPC procedures
- **Why**: Consistent error handling across the application was missing
- **How**: Added `handleTRPCError` function and environment validation utilities for robust error management

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ No formal standards document exists yet, but code follows TypeScript and Next.js best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect adherence to unified-project-structure.md specification
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Jest and Playwright properly configured, tests passing
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed During Review:**
- [x] Enhanced tRPC context with proper Supabase authentication (src/server/api/trpc.ts)
- [x] Improved middleware error handling and redirect logic (src/middleware.ts)
- [x] Fixed duplicate tRPC client exports (src/lib/trpc.ts)
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling utilities (src/lib/errors.ts)
- [x] Verified all tests pass and build succeeds

**Future Considerations (Not blocking):**
- [ ] Consider adding API response caching for production optimization
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging system for production monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for tRPC endpoints when database is connected
- [ ] Add database connection pooling configuration when Supabase is fully configured

### Security Review

**Status: ✓ SECURE**
- Environment variables properly configured with `.env.example` template
- Supabase credentials correctly handled with fallbacks for development
- Authentication middleware properly protects routes
- Cookie handling follows security best practices
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- tRPC procedures properly use `protectedProcedure` for authenticated endpoints

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ✓ OPTIMIZED**
- Next.js build optimization enabled with proper bundle splitting
- tRPC batching configured for efficient API calls
- Static generation working correctly for public pages
- Middleware performance optimized with early returns for development
- No performance warnings in build output (only expected Supabase Edge Runtime warnings)

### Final Status

**✓ APPROVED - Ready for Done**

This story implementation exceeds expectations. The developer has created a robust, production-ready foundation that follows all architectural guidelines. The refactoring performed during QA review has further enhanced the codebase quality, particularly around authentication handling and error management. All acceptance criteria are met, tests pass, and the application builds successfully.
