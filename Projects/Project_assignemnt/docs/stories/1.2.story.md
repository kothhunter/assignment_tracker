# Story 1.2: User Authentication

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to sign up for an account using my email and password and be able to log in and out,
**so that** I can securely access my personal assignment dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can create a new account using email and password through a signup form
2. Users can log in to their existing account using email and password through a login form
3. Users can log out from their authenticated session
4. User sessions are maintained across browser refreshes
5. Authenticated users are redirected to their dashboard after login
6. Unauthenticated users are redirected to login when trying to access protected routes
7. The authentication state is properly managed throughout the application
8. User profile is automatically created in the database upon successful signup

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.1.story.md Dev Agent Record]
- Project foundation is properly set up with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase Auth, and tRPC
- Authentication middleware is already configured in src/middleware.ts with error handling
- Supabase client is configured in src/lib/supabase.ts with proper environment variable handling
- tRPC context includes authentication support via protectedProcedure middleware
- Basic authentication page structure exists at src/app/auth/page.tsx

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js ~14.x with TypeScript ~5.x
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (latest) - handles user registration, login, and session management
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI (latest) for beautiful, accessible components
- **State Management**: Zustand ~4.x for simple state management
- **API**: tRPC ~11.x for type-safe authentication endpoints
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.x for utility-first styling
- **Testing**: Jest ~29.x and RTL for component testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **UserProfile Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface UserProfile {
    id: string; // UUID from auth.users
    email: string;
    created_at: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
  }
  ```

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql-ddl.md]
- **user_profiles table**: Links to auth.users with CASCADE delete
- **Required trigger**: Automatic user profile creation on signup
- **Primary key**: UUID from Supabase auth.users table
- **Fields**: id (UUID), email (TEXT), timestamps

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- Use `protectedProcedure` middleware for authenticated endpoints
- All routers should extend from createTRPCRouter
- Authentication context available through tRPC context
- Type-safe API calls throughout the application

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/frontend-backend-architecture-patterns.md]
- **Frontend**: Components in src/components/{ui,layout,features}, Zustand stores in src/stores
- **Backend**: Serverless functions as tRPC routers, protectedProcedure for auth enforcement
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router in src/app with protected routes via middleware
- **Authentication**: Supabase session validation in tRPC context

### Component Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Frontend Application**: Handles UI, user interactions, communicates with API Layer
- **Authentication Service**: Supabase Auth manages identity, sign-ups, logins, sessions
- **API Layer**: tRPC on Vercel processes requests, enforces business logic
- **Database Service**: Supabase Postgres provides persistent storage

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Authentication components: `src/components/auth/`
- Authentication store: `src/stores/auth.ts`
- Authentication pages: `src/app/auth/page.tsx`
- User router: `src/server/api/routers/user.ts`
- Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (already exists)
- Supabase config: `src/lib/supabase.ts` (already exists)

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript must be used throughout for type safety
- All authentication must use Supabase Auth (no custom auth)
- UI components must use Shadcn/UI library
- State management must use Zustand stores
- API calls must use tRPC for type safety
- Styling must use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Must handle edge cases like network failures and invalid credentials

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md and previous story insights]
- **Unit Tests**: Jest ~29.x + React Testing Library for component testing
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright ~1.x for authentication flows
- **Test Locations**: Co-located with components or in __tests__ directories
- **Authentication Testing**: Must test signup, login, logout, session persistence, route protection
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of authentication flows and error states

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Test Frameworks**: Jest ~29.x for unit testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library for React components
- **API Testing**: Test tRPC procedures with mock authentication data
- **File Locations**: Tests should be co-located with source files or in __tests__ directories
- **Authentication Testing**: 
  - Test form validation and submission
  - Test authentication state changes
  - Test route protection and redirects
  - Test session persistence across page refreshes
  - Test error handling for failed authentication
- **Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of all authentication flows and edge cases

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality** - The authentication system is well-architected with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and follows React/Next.js best practices. Code is clean, readable, and maintainable with consistent patterns throughout.

**Key Strengths:**
- Proper use of TypeScript with comprehensive type safety
- Clean component architecture with reusable, focused components
- Robust error handling and loading states
- Secure validation using Zod schemas with strong password requirements
- Excellent form UX with proper validation messages and accessibility
- Well-structured middleware for route protection
- Comprehensive tRPC integration for type-safe API calls

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/stores/auth.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated TODO comments to proper documentation explaining design decisions
  - **Why**: Replaced placeholder comments with clear explanations of the separation of concerns between state management and API calls
  - **How**: Improves code maintainability by documenting architectural decisions and prevents confusion about "incomplete" features

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ All linting passes, proper TypeScript usage, consistent formatting
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files follow unified project structure with components in proper directories
