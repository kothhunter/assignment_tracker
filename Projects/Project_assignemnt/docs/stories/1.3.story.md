# Story 1.3: Basic Assignment Dashboard UI

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to see a dashboard with a clear, chronological list of my assignments,
**so that** I can quickly understand what's due next.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays all assignments for the authenticated user in chronological order (nearest due date first)
2. Each assignment shows the title, class name, due date, and completion status
3. Assignments are visually distinguished between complete and incomplete status
4. The dashboard is accessible only to authenticated users
5. Dashboard shows appropriate messaging when no assignments exist
6. Due dates are displayed in a human-readable format with clear visual priority for overdue items
7. The dashboard UI matches the clean, "Notion-like" aesthetic established in the application design
8. Dashboard is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Assignment Interface**:
  ```typescript
  type AssignmentStatus = 'incomplete' | 'complete';
  
  interface Assignment {
    id: number;
    user_id: string;
    class_id: number; // Foreign key to Class
    title: string;
    due_date: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
    status: AssignmentStatus;
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- **Class Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Class {
    id: number;
    user_id: string; // Foreign key to UserProfile
    name: string; // e.g., "MATH 113 - Calculus I"
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql-ddl.md]
- **assignments table**: Links to user_profiles and classes with CASCADE delete
- **classes table**: Links to user_profiles with CASCADE delete
- **Primary keys**: BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY
- **Status enum**: assignment_status ('incomplete', 'complete')
- **Timestamps**: due_date as TIMESTAMPTZ for proper chronological sorting

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- Use `assignmentRouter.getAll` procedure with protectedProcedure middleware
- Return joined data with class information for display
- All endpoints must use protectedProcedure for authentication
- Type-safe API calls throughout the application using tRPC client

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/frontend-backend-architecture-patterns.md]
- **Frontend**: Components in src/components/features/assignments/ for assignment-specific UI
- **Backend**: Assignment router in src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts
- **State Management**: Zustand store in src/stores/assignments.ts
- **Routing**: Protected dashboard route at src/app/dashboard/page.tsx

### Component Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Frontend Application**: Handles assignment UI, user interactions, API communication
- **API Layer**: tRPC assignment procedures with business logic and database queries
- **Database Service**: Supabase Postgres provides persistent assignment storage
- **Authentication Service**: Supabase Auth ensures only authenticated users access assignments

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid technical execution with proper TypeScript usage, tRPC integration, and React patterns. The component architecture follows established conventions with clear separation of concerns. However, the assignment router contained incomplete TODO stubs that were refactored during review to provide full CRUD functionality.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts
  - **Change**: Implemented complete database operations for getByClass, create, updateStatus, update, and delete procedures
  - **Why**: Original implementation had TODO stubs that would cause runtime failures and incomplete functionality
  - **How**: Added proper Supabase client initialization, error handling, user authorization checks, and type safety

- **File**: src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts  
  - **Change**: Fixed input validation types from string to number for IDs to match database schema
  - **Why**: Database uses BIGINT primary keys, string types would cause query failures
  - **How**: Updated Zod schemas to use z.number() for id and classId parameters

- **File**: src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts
  - **Change**: Added proper user authorization checks to all mutation operations
  - **Why**: Security requirement to ensure users can only modify their own assignments
  - **How**: Added .eq('user_id', ctx.session.user.id) clauses to all update/delete operations

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript properly implemented, consistent error handling patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly organized according to unified structure specification
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored assignment router to implement complete CRUD operations (src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts)
- [x] Fixed type safety issues with ID parameters (src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts)
- [x] Added proper user authorization to prevent data access violations (src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts)
- [x] Verified responsive design implementation across all components
- [x] Confirmed comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
- [ ] Consider implementing optimistic updates for better UX in assignment status changes
- [ ] Consider adding pagination for large assignment lists in future iterations

### Security Review

✓ **Passed** - All database operations properly use user_id filtering to prevent unauthorized access. Authentication is enforced through protectedProcedure middleware. No sensitive data exposure detected.

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Good** - Database queries are optimized with proper indexing on user_id and due_date. Component memoization opportunities exist but current implementation is acceptable for expected user loads. Date calculations in components are efficient.

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with proper architecture, security, and testing. The refactoring performed addresses critical gaps in the backend API that would have prevented the application from functioning correctly in production.
