# Story 1.4: Class Management

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to create and manage a list of my classes,
**so that** I can keep my course information organized and avoid duplicate entries when adding assignments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can view a list of all their existing classes
2. User can create a new class by providing a class name (e.g., "MATH 113 - Calculus I")
3. User can edit an existing class name
4. User can delete a class (with appropriate confirmation)
5. Class management interface is accessible only to authenticated users
6. Deleting a class should require confirmation and inform user about dependent assignments
7. The class management UI maintains the clean, "Notion-like" aesthetic established in the application
8. Class management is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.3.story.md Dev Agent Record]
- Authentication system is fully implemented with Supabase Auth and tRPC integration
- User profiles are automatically created and linked to auth.users
- Route protection is configured in src/middleware.ts
- Zustand stores pattern established in src/stores/auth.ts and src/stores/assignments.ts
- Shadcn/UI components are configured and ready for use
- tRPC context includes protectedProcedure middleware for authenticated endpoints
- Dashboard implementation patterns can be reused for class management

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js ~14.x with TypeScript ~5.x
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI (latest) for "Notion-like" aesthetic components
- **State Management**: Zustand ~4.x for class data management
- **API**: tRPC ~11.x for type-safe class endpoints
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres with existing user_profiles and classes tables
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.x for responsive utility-first styling
- **Testing**: Jest ~29.x and RTL for component testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Class Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Class {
    id: number;
    user_id: string; // Foreign key to UserProfile
    name: string; // e.g., "MATH 113 - Calculus I"
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- Class names should be descriptive and include course codes when available
- Each class belongs to a specific user and is isolated by user_id
- Classes have a one-to-many relationship with assignments

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql-ddl.md]
- **classes table**: Links to user_profiles with CASCADE delete
- **Primary keys**: BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY
- **Foreign keys**: user_id UUID references user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- **Constraints**: name TEXT NOT NULL for class names
- **Cascade behavior**: Deleting a class will cascade delete all associated assignments

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- Use `classRouter` with getAll, create, update, delete procedures
- All endpoints must use protectedProcedure for authentication
- Input validation using Zod schemas for class name and ID parameters
- Type-safe API calls throughout the application using tRPC client
- Error handling for duplicate class names and cascade deletion warnings

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/frontend-backend-architecture-patterns.md]
- **Frontend**: Components in src/components/features/classes/ for class-specific UI
- **Backend**: Class router in src/server/api/routers/class.ts
- **State Management**: Zustand store in src/stores/classes.ts
- **Routing**: Class management page at src/app/classes/page.tsx
- **Authentication**: protectedProcedure middleware ensures user isolation

### Component Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Frontend Application**: Handles class UI, user interactions, API communication
- **API Layer**: tRPC class procedures with business logic and database queries
- **Database Service**: Supabase Postgres provides persistent class storage
- **Authentication Service**: Supabase Auth ensures only authenticated users access classes

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Class components: `src/components/features/classes/`
- Class store: `src/stores/classes.ts`
- Class management page: `src/app/classes/page.tsx`
- Class router: `src/server/api/routers/class.ts`
- Tests: Co-located with components or in __tests__ directories

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript must be used throughout for type safety
- All database queries must use protectedProcedure for user isolation
- UI components must use Shadcn/UI library for consistency
- State management must use Zustand stores following established patterns
- API calls must use tRPC for type safety
- Styling must use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Must handle edge cases like empty states, loading states, and delete confirmations
- Responsive design required for desktop and mobile
- Cascade deletion must warn users about dependent assignments

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md and previous story insights]
- **Unit Tests**: Jest ~29.x + React Testing Library for component testing
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright ~1.x for class management functionality
- **Test Locations**: Co-located with components or in __tests__ directories
- **Class Testing**: Must test CRUD operations, empty states, confirmations, responsive design
- **Authentication Testing**: Verify class management protection and user data isolation
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of class management logic and UI interactions

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - The implementation demonstrates senior-level code quality with proper architecture patterns, comprehensive error handling, and robust testing coverage. The code follows established patterns from previous stories and maintains consistency throughout the application.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/app/auth/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Wrapped `useSearchParams` in Suspense boundary to fix Next.js build error
  - **Why**: Next.js 14+ requires Suspense boundaries around `useSearchParams` to prevent server/client hydration issues
  - **How**: Extracted component logic into `AuthPageContent` and wrapped it with `<Suspense>` with appropriate fallback

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent** - Code follows TypeScript best practices, proper naming conventions, and clean architecture
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Perfect** - All files are in correct locations per unified project structure guidelines
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **Comprehensive** - Unit tests, E2E tests, and proper test coverage implemented
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **Complete** - All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed critical Next.js build error in auth page (src/app/auth/page.tsx)
- [x] Verified all tRPC procedures use protectedProcedure middleware correctly
- [x] Confirmed duplicate name validation works at both client and server level
- [x] Validated proper error handling and user feedback via toast notifications
- [x] Verified cascade deletion warnings and assignment count functionality
- [x] Confirmed responsive design works across desktop and mobile
- [x] Validated authentication protection via middleware integration
- [x] Confirmed code follows established Zustand patterns from previous stories

### Security Review

**✓ SECURE** - All security requirements properly implemented:
- protectedProcedure middleware ensures user isolation on all endpoints

- No sensitive data logged or exposed in client code
- Route protection via Next.js middleware functioning correctly

### Performance Considerations

**✓ OPTIMIZED** - Performance best practices implemented:
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing on user_id
- Client-side state management reduces unnecessary API calls
- React hooks properly memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Loading states provide good user experience
- Stale time configuration (5 minutes) prevents excessive API calls
- Proper sorting in store maintains chronological order

### Architecture Review

**✓ EXCELLENT ARCHITECTURE**:
- Clean separation of concerns: API layer, state management, and UI components
- Follows established patterns from authentication and assignment stories
- tRPC integration provides end-to-end type safety
