## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.4.story.md Dev Agent Record]
- Class management system is fully implemented with complete CRUD operations
- Classes table exists with user_id foreign key constraints
- tRPC class router is available at src/server/api/routers/class.ts
- Zustand class store exists at src/stores/classes.ts with established patterns
- Shadcn/UI components are configured (dropdown-menu, dialog, alert-dialog)
- Authentication middleware protects /classes route
- Dashboard navigation patterns established in src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
- Toast notifications implemented using Sonner library

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js ~14.x with TypeScript ~5.x
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI (latest) for "Notion-like" aesthetic components
- **State Management**: Zustand ~4.x for assignment data management
- **API**: tRPC ~11.x for type-safe assignment endpoints
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres with existing assignments and classes tables
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.x for responsive utility-first styling
- **Testing**: Jest ~29.x and RTL for component testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Assignment Interface**:
  ```typescript
  type AssignmentStatus = 'incomplete' | 'complete';
  
  interface Assignment {
    id: number;
    user_id: string; // Foreign key to UserProfile
    class_id: number; // Foreign key to Class - MUST exist and belong to user
    title: string;
    due_date: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
    status: AssignmentStatus;
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- Assignment must be linked to an existing class via class_id foreign key
- Each assignment belongs to a specific user and is isolated by user_id
- Default status is 'incomplete' when created
- Due dates must be properly formatted ISO 8601 timestamps

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql-ddl.md]
- **assignments table**: Links to both user_profiles and classes with CASCADE delete
- **Primary keys**: BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY
- **Foreign keys**: 
  - user_id UUID references user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  - class_id BIGINT references classes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- **Constraints**: title TEXT NOT NULL, due_date TIMESTAMPTZ
- **ENUM type**: assignment_status with values 'incomplete', 'complete'

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- Use `assignmentRouter` with getAll, createManual procedures
- All endpoints must use protectedProcedure for authentication
- Input validation using Zod schemas for assignment data
- Type-safe API calls throughout the application using tRPC client
- Error handling for invalid class_id and required field validation
- createManual procedure signature: `.input(z.object({ title: z.string(), class_id: z.number(), due_date: z.string() }))`

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/frontend-backend-architecture-patterns.md]
- **Frontend**: Components in src/components/features/assignments/ for assignment-specific UI
- **Backend**: Assignment router in src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts
- **State Management**: Zustand store in src/stores/assignments.ts
- **Routing**: Assignment form integrated into dashboard at src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
- **Authentication**: protectedProcedure middleware ensures user isolation

### Component Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Frontend Application**: Handles assignment UI, user interactions, API communication
- **API Layer**: tRPC assignment procedures with business logic and database queries
- **Database Service**: Supabase Postgres provides persistent assignment storage
- **Authentication Service**: Supabase Auth ensures only authenticated users access assignments

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Assignment components: `src/components/features/assignments/`
- Assignment store: `src/stores/assignments.ts`
- Assignment router: `src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts`
- Dashboard integration: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Tests: Co-located with components or in __tests__ directories

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript must be used throughout for type safety
- All database queries must use protectedProcedure for user isolation
- UI components must use Shadcn/UI library for consistency
- State management must use Zustand stores following established patterns
- API calls must use tRPC for type safety
- Styling must use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Must handle edge cases like empty states, loading states, and form validation
- Responsive design required for desktop and mobile
- Assignment creation must validate class ownership by user
- Due dates must be properly formatted and validated
- Form must prevent submission with invalid or missing data

### Integration Requirements
- Must integrate with existing class management system from Story 1.4
- Assignment form must populate class dropdown from user's existing classes
- Must use established authentication patterns from previous stories
- Must follow dashboard integration patterns established in Story 1.3
- Assignment list should integrate with existing dashboard layout
- Toast notifications should use existing Sonner implementation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation with solid architecture and comprehensive testing.** The assignment creation feature demonstrates strong adherence to established patterns with proper TypeScript usage, effective error handling, and well-structured components. The developer successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with a clean, maintainable codebase that follows the project's architectural guidelines.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts`
  - **Change**: Eliminated extensive code duplication by extracting common patterns
  - **Why**: Original implementation repeated Supabase client creation and query logic across 6 procedures
  - **How**: Created reusable `createSupabaseClient()` factory, `ASSIGNMENT_SELECT_QUERY` constant, validation schemas, and `verifyClassOwnership()` utility, reducing code by ~200 lines while improving maintainability

- **File**: `src/components/features/assignments/assignment-form.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added test data attributes for E2E testing compatibility
  - **Why**: E2E tests referenced `data-testid` attributes that were missing from components
  - **How**: Added `data-testid="assignment-title-input"`, `data-testid="class-select"`, and `data-testid="due-date-input"` to form controls

- **File**: `src/components/features/assignments/assignment-card.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added test data attribute for E2E testing
  - **Why**: E2E tests needed to locate assignment cards for verification
  - **How**: Added `data-testid="assignment-card"` to Card component

- **File**: `src/components/features/assignments/__tests__/assignment-form.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed incorrect tRPC mock import structure
  - **Why**: Tests were mocking `trpc` instead of `api` export, causing potential test failures
  - **How**: Updated all mock references from `mockTrpc` to `mockApi` to match actual import structure

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **Excellent** - TypeScript usage, error handling, and component patterns all follow best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ **Perfect** - All files placed in correct locations per unified project structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ **Comprehensive** - Unit, integration, and E2E tests cover all acceptance criteria and edge cases
- All ACs Met: ✓ **Complete** - Every acceptance criterion fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Eliminated code duplication in assignment router through utility extraction
- [x] Added missing test data attributes for E2E test compatibility  
- [x] Fixed test mock structure to match actual API imports
- [x] Verified comprehensive error handling throughout the implementation
- [x] Confirmed proper TypeScript types and validation schemas
- [x] Validated responsive design and accessibility features
- [x] Ensured proper authentication and user data isolation

### Security Review

**Excellent security implementation.** All database operations properly enforce user isolation through `protectedProcedure` middleware and explicit `user_id` filtering. Class ownership validation prevents assignment creation for unauthorized classes. No security vulnerabilities identified.

### Performance Considerations

**Well-optimized implementation.** Zustand store provides efficient state management with automatic sorting. Optimistic updates improve UX. Database queries use proper indexing on `user_id` and `due_date`. Form validation prevents unnecessary API calls. No performance issues identified.

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

**Summary:** Outstanding implementation that exceeds expectations. The developer delivered a complete, well-tested assignment creation feature with proper architecture, comprehensive error handling, and excellent user experience. Post-review refactoring eliminated technical debt and improved maintainability. This story is ready for production deployment.
