# Story 1.6: View and Filter Assignments

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to see all my assignments on the dashboard and be able to filter them by class,
**so that** I can focus on a specific subject.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays all user's assignments in chronological order by due date
2. Assignment list includes assignment title, class name, and due date for each item
3. Filter dropdown/selection shows all user's classes with option to show all assignments
4. When a class is selected, only assignments from that class are displayed
5. Filter maintains selection state while user navigates within the dashboard
6. Assignments display consistently whether filtered or unfiltered
7. Empty state message when no assignments match the selected filter
8. Filter interface maintains the clean "Notion-like" aesthetic
9. Assignment filtering is accessible only to authenticated users
10. Filter functionality is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.5.story.md Dev Agent Record]
- Complete assignment management system implemented with CRUD operations
- AssignmentList and AssignmentCard components exist in src/components/features/assignments/
- tRPC assignment router available at src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts with getAll procedure
- Zustand assignment store exists at src/stores/assignments.ts with established patterns
- Dashboard integration patterns established in src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
- Shadcn/UI components configured (dropdown-menu, dialog, alert-dialog)
- Authentication middleware protects assignment operations via protectedProcedure
- Class management system fully implemented with classes table and user isolation
- Toast notifications implemented using Sonner library

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js ~14.x with TypeScript ~5.x
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI (latest) for "Notion-like" aesthetic components
- **State Management**: Zustand ~4.x for assignment and filter state management
- **API**: tRPC ~11.x for type-safe assignment endpoints with class data
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres with existing assignments and classes tables
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.x for responsive utility-first styling
- **Testing**: Jest ~29.x and RTL for component testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Assignment Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Assignment {
    id: number;
    user_id: string; // Foreign key to UserProfile
    class_id: number; // Foreign key to Class
    title: string;
    due_date: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
    status: AssignmentStatus;
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- **Class Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Class {
    id: number;
    user_id: string; // Foreign key to UserProfile
    name: string; // e.g., "MATH 113 - Calculus I"
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- Assignment data must include class information for filtering functionality
- Each assignment and class belongs to specific user and is isolated by user_id
- Filter operations are client-side based on class_id associations

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- Use existing `assignmentRouter.getAll` procedure enhanced to include class data
- All endpoints must use protectedProcedure for authentication
- Type-safe API calls throughout the application using tRPC client
- Assignment data should include joined class information for display and filtering
- Enhanced getAll procedure should return assignments with class names

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/frontend-backend-architecture-patterns.md]
- **Frontend**: Components in src/components/features/assignments/ for assignment-specific UI
- **Backend**: Assignment router in src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts
- **State Management**: Zustand store in src/stores/assignments.ts with filter state
- **Routing**: Filter integration into dashboard at src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
- **Authentication**: protectedProcedure middleware ensures user isolation

### Component Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Frontend Application**: Handles assignment filtering UI, user interactions, state management
- **API Layer**: tRPC assignment procedures with enhanced data fetching for class information
- **Database Service**: Supabase Postgres provides persistent assignment and class storage
- **Authentication Service**: Supabase Auth ensures only authenticated users access assignments

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Assignment filter component: `src/components/features/assignments/assignment-filter.tsx`
- Enhanced assignment list: `src/components/features/assignments/assignment-list.tsx`
- Assignment store with filter state: `src/stores/assignments.ts`
- Assignment router enhancement: `src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts`
- Dashboard integration: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Tests: Co-located with components or in __tests__ directories

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript must be used throughout for type safety
- All database queries must use protectedProcedure for user isolation
- UI components must use Shadcn/UI library for consistency
- State management must use Zustand stores following established patterns
- API calls must use tRPC for type safety
- Styling must use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Must handle edge cases like empty states, loading states, and filter persistence
- Responsive design required for desktop and mobile
- Filter selection must validate user's class ownership
- Client-side filtering based on class_id relationships
- Filter state must persist during dashboard navigation

### Integration Requirements
- Must integrate with existing assignment display system from Stories 1.3-1.5
- Filter component must work with existing AssignmentList and AssignmentCard components
- Must use established authentication patterns from previous stories
- Must follow dashboard integration patterns established in previous stories
- Filter functionality should integrate with existing Zustand assignment store
- Must use existing class data from class management system (Story 1.4)
