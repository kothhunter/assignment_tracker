  - **Change**: Created reusable custom hook for file upload functionality
  - **Why**: Improves code reusability, separation of concerns, and testability
  - **How**: Extracted file validation, drag-and-drop, and file selection logic into a dedicated hook

- **File**: `src/hooks/index.ts`
  - **Change**: Added export for the new useFileUpload hook
  - **Why**: Maintains consistent import patterns across the application
  - **How**: Added hook to the central hooks export file

- **File**: `src/components/features/syllabus/syllabus-upload.tsx`
  - **Change**: Improved character counter UI with visual feedback for invalid length
