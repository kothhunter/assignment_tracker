# Story 2.2: AI Parsing & Assignment Extraction

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the system to use an AI agent to read my syllabus text and extract a structured list of assignments,
**so that** I don't have to identify them manually.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System receives syllabus text and class ID from upload interface (Story 2.1)
2. AI agent processes syllabus text using OpenAI API to identify assignments
3. AI extracts assignment titles, due dates, and relevant details from unstructured syllabus content
4. System parses and validates AI response into structured assignment data
5. AI parsing handles various syllabus formats (PDF text, pasted text, different academic styles)
6. System returns structured list of assignments for user review
7. Error handling for AI parsing failures, API timeouts, and invalid responses
8. AI parsing is accessible only to authenticated users with valid class ownership
9. System logs AI parsing attempts for debugging and optimization
10. Parsed assignments include association with the selected class

- Complete syllabus upload interface available with file upload and text paste functionality
- Supabase Storage integration established for file handling
- Class management system integration completed with proper authentication
- tRPC API patterns established with protectedProcedure for user authorization
- Form validation and error handling patterns implemented
- Upload interface provides syllabus text and class ID for AI parsing
- Ready integration point: syllabus text and class selection data available

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language**: TypeScript ~5.x for full-stack type safety
- **API Framework**: tRPC ~11.x for type-safe AI parsing endpoint
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API via POST /v1/chat/completions endpoint
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres with existing classes and assignments tables
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with protectedProcedure middleware
- **Testing**: Jest ~29.x for unit testing, mocking OpenAI API responses
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (if processing uploaded files)

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Assignment Interface**: Target structure for parsed assignments
  ```typescript
  interface Assignment {
    id: number;
    user_id: string;
    class_id: number; // Foreign key to Class
    title: string;
    due_date: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
    status: AssignmentStatus;
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- **Class Interface**: Available for validation of class ownership
  ```typescript
  interface Class {
    id: number;
    user_id: string;
    name: string;
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- AI parsing must extract and format data to match Assignment interface requirements
- User authorization required to ensure class ownership before parsing

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- **AI Router**: Implement `aiRouter.parseSyllabus` procedure
- **Input Validation**: Use Zod schemas for syllabus text and class ID
- **Authentication**: All endpoints must use protectedProcedure
- **Type Safety**: Maintain full TypeScript type safety throughout AI workflow
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses for frontend consumption

### External API Integration
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- **OpenAI API**: Use POST /v1/chat/completions endpoint for AI parsing
- **Authentication**: Server-side API key management for OpenAI
- **Supabase API**: Database operations via supabase-js client library
- **API Key Security**: Environment variables for sensitive credentials

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- **Syllabus Parsing Workflow Step 2**: This story implements the AI parsing step
- **Input**: Syllabus text and class ID from upload interface (Story 2.1)
- **Processing**: Send text to OpenAI API for assignment extraction
- **Output**: Structured assignment list for user review (Story 2.3)
- **Workflow Sequence**:
  1. Receive syllabus text and class ID from frontend
  2. Send text to OpenAI for parsing
  3. Process AI response into structured format
  4. Return assignment list for user review

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality** - The developer James has delivered a comprehensive AI parsing system that meets all requirements with thoughtful architecture and robust error handling. The code demonstrates mature TypeScript practices with proper type safety, validation, and modular design. All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented with attention to security, error handling, and user experience.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/lib/openai.ts
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling with specific categorization for different OpenAI API failure modes
  - **Why**: Original error handling was generic; users need specific actionable feedback for different error types
  - **How**: Added detailed error detection for auth failures, rate limits, timeouts, quota issues, and JSON parsing errors with user-friendly messages

- **File**: src/server/api/routers/ai.ts  
  - **Change**: Enhanced input validation with content length limits and whitespace validation
  - **Why**: Prevents API abuse and ensures quality input for AI processing
  - **How**: Added min/max length constraints (10-50k chars) and whitespace-only detection using Zod refinement

- **File**: src/server/api/routers/ai.ts
  - **Change**: Added input sanitization to prevent prompt injection attacks
  - **Why**: Security best practice to prevent malicious prompt injection through syllabus content
  - **How**: Implemented character filtering to remove potentially dangerous special characters while preserving valid academic content

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ No formal coding standards file found, but code follows excellent TypeScript/Next.js patterns
- **Project Structure**: ✓ All files placed correctly according to unified-project-structure.md
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ No formal strategy document, but comprehensive unit and integration tests implemented
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced error handling with specific OpenAI API error categorization (src/lib/openai.ts)
- [x] Improved input validation with length limits and whitespace detection (src/server/api/routers/ai.ts)
- [x] Added security hardening through input sanitization (src/server/api/routers/ai.ts)
- [x] Validated comprehensive test coverage across all scenarios
- [ ] Consider adding retry logic with exponential backoff for transient OpenAI API failures
- [ ] Consider adding telemetry/metrics collection for AI parsing success rates
- [ ] Consider implementing caching for similar syllabus content to reduce API costs

### Security Review

**Strong security implementation** - All security concerns have been properly addressed:
- ✅ Authentication enforced via protectedProcedure
- ✅ Authorization validated through class ownership verification  
- ✅ Input sanitization implemented to prevent prompt injection
- ✅ API key management using environment variables
- ✅ No sensitive data logged (only user ID and content length)
- ✅ Proper error message sanitization to avoid information leakage

### Performance Considerations

**Well-optimized for performance**:
- ✅ Lazy OpenAI client initialization to prevent build-time issues
- ✅ Appropriate model selection (gpt-4o-mini for cost efficiency)
- ✅ Reasonable token limits (2000 max_tokens) to control costs
- ✅ Low temperature (0.1) setting for consistent parsing results
- ✅ Input length validation to prevent oversized requests
- ⚠️ No caching implemented - could reduce API costs for similar content
- ⚠️ No retry logic - could improve reliability for transient failures

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

This implementation exceeds expectations with comprehensive error handling, security considerations, and robust testing. The developer has delivered production-ready code that fully satisfies all acceptance criteria. The refactoring improvements I made enhance the system's resilience and security without changing core functionality. Outstanding work on a complex AI integration story.
