# Story 2.3: Review and Confirmation Screen

## Status  
Done

## Story

5. User can add new assignments that AI missed from the syllabus
6. Interface validates edited data (dates, required fields) before allowing confirmation
7. User can confirm final assignment list for saving to their schedule
8. Interface provides clear feedback for validation errors and successful confirmation
9. Review interface maintains consistent "Notion-like" aesthetic with the rest of the app

- Ready integration point: AI parsing provides structured assignment list for review

[Source: 2.1.story.md Dev Agent Record]
- Syllabus upload interface provides class selection and content input
- Shadcn/UI components configured for "Notion-like" aesthetic
- Form validation patterns established using Zod schemas
- Toast notification system implemented using Sonner library
- Authentication and user data isolation patterns established
- Responsive design patterns and mobile support implemented

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js ~14.x with TypeScript ~5.x for type-safe review interface
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI (latest) for consistent "Notion-like" aesthetic components
- **State Management**: Zustand ~4.x for complex review state management if needed
- **API**: tRPC ~11.x for type-safe assignment review and confirmation endpoints
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres with assignments table ready for data persistence
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.x for responsive utility-first styling
- **Testing**: Jest ~29.x and RTL for component testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E testing
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with protectedProcedure middleware

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Assignment Interface**: Target structure for confirmed assignments
  ```typescript
  interface Assignment {
    id: number;
    user_id: string;
    class_id: number; // Foreign key to Class
    title: string;
    due_date: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
    status: AssignmentStatus;
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- **ParsedAssignment Interface**: Input from AI parsing (Story 2.2)
  ```typescript
  interface ParsedAssignment {
    title: string;
    due_date: string;
    description?: string;
    confidence_score?: number;
  }
  ```
- Review interface must transform ParsedAssignment data to Assignment format
- User can edit all fields except user_id and class_id (inherited from context)

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- **AI Router**: Use existing `aiRouter.parseSyllabus` output as input
- **Assignment Router**: Prepare for `assignmentRouter.createBatch` for Story 2.4
- **Input Validation**: Use Zod schemas for edited assignment data validation
- **Authentication**: All endpoints must use protectedProcedure
- **Type Safety**: Maintain full TypeScript type safety throughout review workflow
- **Temporary Storage**: Consider session-based storage for review state

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- **Syllabus Parsing Workflow Step 4**: This story implements the review step
- **Input**: Structured assignment list from AI parsing (Story 2.2)
- **Processing**: User reviews, edits, adds, and deletes assignments
- **Output**: Confirmed assignment list for saving (Story 2.4)
- **Workflow Sequence**:
  1. Receive parsed assignment list from Story 2.2
  2. Display assignments in editable review interface
  3. Allow user to edit, add, delete assignments
  4. Validate all changes and provide feedback
  5. Confirm final list and prepare for Story 2.4 save operation

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/frontend-backend-architecture-patterns.md]
- **Frontend**: Components in src/components/features/syllabus/ for review-specific UI
- **Backend**: Extend AI router or create review endpoint in src/server/api/routers/
- **State Management**: Complex review state may require Zustand store
- **Routing**: File-based routing via Next.js App Router for review interface
- **Authentication**: protectedProcedure middleware ensures user authentication

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Assignment review component: `src/components/features/syllabus/assignment-review.tsx`
- Review page route: `src/app/dashboard/review-assignments/page.tsx`
- Review state management: `src/stores/assignment-review.ts` (if needed)
- API endpoint: `src/server/api/routers/ai.ts` (extend) or new review router
- Type definitions: `src/types/syllabus.ts` or extend existing `src/types/index.ts`
- Tests: Co-located with components or in __tests__ directories

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript must be used throughout for type safety
- All API operations must use protectedProcedure for user authentication
- UI components must use Shadcn/UI library for design consistency
- Form validation must provide clear, real-time user feedback
- Must handle edge cases like empty parsing results, API failures, network errors
- Responsive design required for desktop and mobile devices
- Review state must persist during editing session
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing authentication patterns
- Assignment data must be validated before confirmation
- Interface must provide clear visual feedback for all user actions

### Integration Requirements
- Must receive input from AI parsing results (Story 2.2)
- Must prepare output for assignment saving functionality (Story 2.4)
- Must integrate with existing class management and authentication systems
- Review state should not persist between sessions
- Error handling must use established toast notification patterns
- Must maintain audit trail of user edits for debugging
- Assignment edits must preserve class association from original parsing context
- Must validate user permissions for the associated class

### Testing

- **Test Frameworks**: Jest ~29.x for unit testing review functionality
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library for React component testing
- **API Testing**: Test tRPC review procedures with mocked AI parsing data
- **File Locations**: Tests co-located with source files or in __tests__ directories
- **Assignment Review Testing**:
  - Test component rendering with parsed assignment data
  - Test assignment editing functionality and form validation
  - Test add/delete assignment features with proper state management
  - Test confirmation workflow and data preparation for Story 2.4
  - Test error handling for validation failures and API errors
  - Test responsive design behavior across devices
