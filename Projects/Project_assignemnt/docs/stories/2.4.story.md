# Story 2.4: Save Confirmed Assignments to Schedule

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the approved assignments to be saved permanently to my schedule,
**so that** they appear on my main dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System receives confirmed assignment list from review interface (Story 2.3)
2. Each confirmed assignment is validated and saved to the assignments table
3. Assignments are properly associated with the correct user and class
4. System provides success feedback when save operation completes
5. System handles errors gracefully with appropriate error messages
6. Saved assignments immediately appear on the main dashboard
7. Assignment data maintains integrity with proper timestamps and status
8. System prevents duplicate assignments from being saved
9. Save operation is transactional - either all assignments save or none do
10. System provides loading states during save operations

- Shadcn/UI components configured for consistent user experience

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend**: TypeScript ~5.x with tRPC ~11.x for type-safe assignment persistence
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres ~15.x for reliable assignment storage
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with protectedProcedure middleware
- **API**: tRPC assignment router for batch assignment creation
- **Frontend**: Next.js ~14.x with TypeScript for save interface integration
- **State Management**: Zustand ~4.x if complex save state management needed
- **Testing**: Jest ~29.x for API testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E workflow testing
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI for consistent feedback and loading states

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Assignment Interface**: Target structure for persisted assignments
  ```typescript
  interface Assignment {
    id: number;
    user_id: string; // From authenticated user session
    class_id: number; // Foreign key to Class
    title: string;
    due_date: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
    status: AssignmentStatus; // Defaults to 'incomplete'
    created_at: string; // Auto-generated timestamp
  }
  ```
- **Input Data**: ReviewableAssignment from Story 2.3 review interface
- Save operation transforms reviewed data to Assignment format
- Must validate class_id exists and belongs to authenticated user
- Assignment status initialized to 'incomplete' for new assignments

### Database Schema Context
[Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql-ddl.md]
- **Assignments Table**: `public.assignments` with proper foreign key constraints
- **Primary Key**: `id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY`
- **Foreign Keys**: `user_id` references `user_profiles(id)`, `class_id` references `classes(id)`
- **Status Type**: `public.assignment_status` ENUM ('incomplete', 'complete')
- **Cascade Deletes**: ON DELETE CASCADE for user and class relationships
- **Constraints**: NOT NULL constraints on required fields (title, user_id, class_id)

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- **Assignment Router**: Extend with `createBatch` procedure for multiple assignment saves
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema for batch assignment creation
- **Authentication**: Use protectedProcedure to ensure user authentication
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type safety from input to database
- **Error Handling**: Proper tRPC error responses for validation and database failures
- **Transactional Operations**: Ensure atomic batch operations for data integrity

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- **Syllabus Parsing Workflow Step 6**: This story implements the save step
- **Input**: Confirmed assignment list from Story 2.3 review interface
- **Processing**: Validate, transform, and batch save assignments to database
- **Output**: Success confirmation and updated dashboard with new assignments
- **Workflow Sequence**:
  1. Receive confirmed assignment list from review interface
  2. Validate assignment data and user permissions
  3. Transform data to Assignment model format
  4. Execute transactional batch insert to database
  5. Provide success feedback and navigate to dashboard
  6. Dashboard displays newly saved assignments

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- API endpoint: `src/server/api/routers/assignment.ts` (extend with createBatch)
- Save integration: Extend existing review interface at `src/components/features/syllabus/assignment-review.tsx`

### Technical Constraints
- All API operations must use protectedProcedure for user authentication
- Database operations must be transactional to prevent partial saves
- Assignment data must pass both client and server-side validation
- Save operations must handle network failures and timeouts gracefully
- User must only save assignments for classes they own
- Duplicate prevention based on title and due_date within same class
- Must maintain referential integrity with existing user and class data
- Loading states required for better user experience during save operations
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable

### Integration Requirements
- Must integrate with existing assignment dashboard queries and display
- Save confirmation must trigger proper cache invalidation for fresh data
- Navigation patterns must follow existing application routing
- Error handling must use established toast notification patterns
- Success feedback must clearly indicate completion and next steps
- Must work seamlessly with existing authentication and authorization
- Save operations must preserve all user edits from review interface
- Assignment ordering and filtering on dashboard must include new assignments

### Testing
- **API Testing**: Test createBatch procedure with valid and invalid data
- **Validation Testing**: Test assignment field validation and duplicate prevention
- **Security Testing**: Test authentication and authorization for assignment saves
