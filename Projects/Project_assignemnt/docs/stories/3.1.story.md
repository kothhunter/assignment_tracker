### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js ~14.x with TypeScript for assignment detail views
- **Backend**: TypeScript ~5.x with tRPC ~11.x for type-safe assignment plan initiation
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres ~15.x for assignment plan storage
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with protectedProcedure middleware
- **API**: tRPC assignment router for plan initiation endpoints
- **State Management**: Zustand ~4.x if complex form state management needed
- **Testing**: Jest ~29.x for component testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E workflow testing
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI for consistent form inputs and feedback components

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Assignment Interface**: Source of assignment information for detail view
  ```typescript
  interface Assignment {
    id: number;
    user_id: string; // From authenticated user session
    class_id: number; // Foreign key to Class
    title: string;
    due_date: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
    status: AssignmentStatus;
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- **AssignmentPlan Interface**: Target structure for plan initiation
  ```typescript
  interface AssignmentPlan {
    id: number;
    assignment_id: number; // Foreign key to Assignment
    original_instructions: string; // User-submitted instructions
    sub_tasks: SubTask[]; // Initially empty array
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- Plan creation initializes with user instructions, sub_tasks populated in subsequent stories
- Must validate assignment_id exists and belongs to authenticated user

### Database Schema Context
[Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql-ddl.md]
- **Assignments Table**: `public.assignments` for retrieving assignment details
- **Assignment Plans Table**: Will need table for storing assignment plans (referenced in DDL notes)
- **Primary Keys**: Auto-generated BIGINT identities for both tables
- **Foreign Keys**: `assignment_id` references `assignments(id)`, proper cascade relationships
- **User Security**: Plans associated with assignments, which are user-owned
- **Constraints**: NOT NULL constraints on required fields (assignment_id, original_instructions)

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- **Assignment Router**: Extend with `initiatePlan` procedure for plan creation
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema for assignment instruction submission
- **Authentication**: Use protectedProcedure to ensure user authentication
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type safety from input to database
- **Error Handling**: Proper tRPC error responses for validation and database failures
- **Response Format**: Return plan ID and success status for navigation

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- **Interactive Assignment Plan Generation Workflow Step 1**: This story implements the instruction submission step
- **Input**: Assignment selection from dashboard + detailed instructions from user
- **Processing**: Validate assignment ownership, store instructions, create initial plan record
- **Output**: Success confirmation and navigation to plan generation interface (Story 3.2)
- **Workflow Sequence**:
  1. User selects assignment from dashboard
  2. System displays assignment detail view with instruction input
  3. User enters detailed assignment instructions
  4. System validates and stores instructions as initial AssignmentPlan
  5. Navigate to AI plan generation interface for Story 3.2

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Assignment detail page: `src/app/assignments/[id]/page.tsx`

- Form submissions must handle network failures and timeouts gracefully
- Navigation must maintain proper URL structure and SEO
- Loading states required for better user experience during API calls
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing dashboard and navigation patterns

### Integration Requirements
- Must integrate with existing assignment dashboard for seamless navigation

- Form submission must trigger proper state management for subsequent planning interface
- Navigation patterns must follow existing application routing conventions
- Error handling must use established toast notification patterns
- Success feedback must clearly indicate next steps in the planning workflow
- Must work seamlessly with existing authentication and authorization
- Component should be reusable for other assignment-related detail views
