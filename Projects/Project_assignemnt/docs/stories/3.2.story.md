# Story 3.2: Initial Sub-Task Generation & Review

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the AI to generate an initial high-level plan of sub-tasks for my review,
**so that** I have a starting point to refine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System displays the plan generation interface after assignment instruction submission
2. User can see the submitted assignment instructions displayed for reference
3. System calls AI to generate initial sub-task plan based on the instructions
4. System displays the generated sub-tasks in a clear, reviewable format
5. Each sub-task shows step number, title, and description/overview
6. User can see loading states during AI generation process
7. System handles AI generation errors gracefully with retry options
8. Generated plan is automatically saved to the assignment plan record
9. User can proceed to refinement phase (Story 3.3) from this interface
10. Only the assignment owner can view and generate plans for their assignments

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js ~14.x with TypeScript for plan generation interface
- **Backend**: TypeScript ~5.x with tRPC ~11.x for type-safe AI integration endpoints
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres ~15.x for sub-task storage and plan persistence
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with protectedProcedure middleware for secure access
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API via POST /v1/chat/completions for sub-task generation
- **API**: tRPC routers for AI-powered plan generation endpoints
- **State Management**: Zustand ~4.x for complex plan generation state if needed
- **Testing**: Jest ~29.x for component testing, Playwright ~1.x for E2E workflow testing
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI for consistent plan display and feedback components

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **AssignmentPlan Interface**: Target structure for plan storage and retrieval
  ```typescript
  interface AssignmentPlan {
    id: number;
    assignment_id: number; // Foreign key to Assignment
    original_instructions: string; // From Story 3.1
    sub_tasks: SubTask[]; // Populated in this story
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- **SubTask Interface**: Structure for generated sub-tasks
  ```typescript
  interface SubTask {
    id: number;
    plan_id: number; // Foreign key to AssignmentPlan
    step_number: number; // Sequential ordering
    title: string; // Short descriptive title
    generated_prompt: string; // Detailed prompt for final output (Story 3.4)
  }
  ```
- Plan retrieved using assignment_id, sub_tasks populated with AI-generated content
- Must validate assignment_id exists and belongs to authenticated user for security

### Database Schema Context
[Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql-ddl.md]
- **Assignment Plans Table**: Storage for plan records with foreign key to assignments
- **Sub-Tasks Table**: Storage for generated sub-tasks with proper relationships
- **Primary Keys**: Auto-generated BIGINT identities for both tables
- **Foreign Keys**: `plan_id` references `assignment_plans(id)`, proper cascade relationships
- **User Security**: Plans associated with assignments, which are user-owned via user_id
- **Constraints**: NOT NULL constraints on required fields (plan_id, step_number, title)
- **Ordering**: step_number for maintaining sub-task sequence in generated plans

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]
- **AI Router**: Implement `generatePlan` procedure in ai router for sub-task generation
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema for assignment plan generation requests
- **Authentication**: Use protectedProcedure to ensure user authentication and authorization
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type safety from OpenAI integration to database storage
- **Error Handling**: Proper tRPC error responses for AI failures and database issues
- **Response Format**: Return generated sub-tasks with proper structure for frontend display

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- **Interactive Assignment Plan Generation Workflow Steps 2-3**: This story implements the initial generation step
- **Input**: Assignment instructions from AssignmentPlan.original_instructions (from Story 3.1)
- **Processing**: Call OpenAI API to generate structured sub-task list, save to database
- **Output**: Display generated sub-tasks for user review, prepare for refinement (Story 3.3)
- **Workflow Sequence**:
  1. Retrieve assignment plan and instructions from database
  2. Call OpenAI API with effective prompts for sub-task breakdown
  3. Parse and validate AI response into SubTask structure
  4. Save generated sub-tasks to database with proper relationships
  5. Display generated plan for user review and refinement
