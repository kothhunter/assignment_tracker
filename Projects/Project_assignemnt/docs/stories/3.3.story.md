# Story 3.3: Conversational Plan Refinement

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to use natural language in the chat to add, remove, or change the sub-tasks,
**so that** the final plan perfectly matches my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System displays a chat interface after initial sub-task generation (from Story 3.2)
2. User can see the current plan and generated sub-tasks alongside the chat
3. User can type natural language commands to modify the plan (e.g., "add a step about researching sources", "remove step 3", "change step 2 to focus on analysis")
4. System calls AI to interpret user refinement requests and update sub-tasks accordingly
5. System shows updated sub-tasks immediately after each refinement command
6. User can see a history of their refinement commands and changes made
7. System handles refinement errors gracefully with clear feedback
8. User can undo their last refinement change if needed
9. System automatically saves all refinement changes to the assignment plan record
10. User can proceed to final prompt generation (Story 3.4) when satisfied with the plan
11. Only the assignment owner can view and refine plans for their assignments

  interface AssignmentPlan {
    id: number;
    assignment_id: number; // Foreign key to Assignment
    original_instructions: string; // From Story 3.1
    sub_tasks: SubTask[]; // Updated through refinement in this story
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- **SubTask Interface**: Core structure for refined sub-tasks
  ```typescript
  interface SubTask {
    id: number;
    plan_id: number; // Foreign key to AssignmentPlan
    step_number: number; // Reordered during refinement
    title: string; // Modified through refinement commands

  ```typescript
  interface RefinementMessage {
    id: number;
    plan_id: number; // Foreign key to AssignmentPlan
    message_type: 'user' | 'system';
    content: string; // User command or system response
    timestamp: string;
    change_summary?: string; // What changed in the plan
  }
  ```

- **Refinement Messages Table**: New table for chat history and change tracking
- **Primary Keys**: Auto-generated BIGINT identities for all tables
- **Foreign Keys**: `plan_id` references `assignment_plans(id)`, proper cascade relationships
- **User Security**: Plans associated with assignments, which are user-owned via user_id
- **Constraints**: NOT NULL constraints on required fields (plan_id, step_number, title, message_type)
- **Ordering**: step_number for maintaining sub-task sequence after refinement changes

### API Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification-trpc.md]

- **Workflow Sequence**:
  1. Load current assignment plan and display in chat interface
  2. User enters natural language refinement command
  3. Call OpenAI API with current plan + refinement request
  4. Parse and validate AI response into updated SubTask structure
  5. Save refined sub-tasks to database with change tracking
  6. Display updated plan and confirmation message
  7. Repeat until user approves final plan for Story 3.4
