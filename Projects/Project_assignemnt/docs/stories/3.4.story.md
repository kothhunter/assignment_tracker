- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI for consistent prompt display and copy functionality components

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **AssignmentPlan Interface**: Final completion tracking
  ```typescript
  interface AssignmentPlan {
    id: number;
    assignment_id: number; // Foreign key to Assignment
    original_instructions: string; // From Story 3.1
    sub_tasks: SubTask[]; // Refined through Story 3.3, finalized in this story
    created_at: string;
  }
  ```
- **SubTask Interface**: Core structure with final generated prompts
  ```typescript
  interface SubTask {
    id: number;
    plan_id: number; // Foreign key to AssignmentPlan
