### Projected-Journal v0 — Core Principles
1. **Language / Runtime** Python 3.12 only.  
2. **Libraries** `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `pydantic`, `python-dateutil`.  
3. **Outputs** A single 17-column *Journal.xlsx* (USD) covering exactly 13 weeks.  
4. **Four input workbooks**  
   • *Beginning BS.xlsx* – fixed schema  
   • *GAAP Mapping.xlsx* – fixed schema  
   • *Cashflow Mapping.xlsx* – fixed schema  
   • *AP Cash Grid.xlsx* – **flexible schema** (agent must auto-detect).  

The agent **must** abort early with a structured error response if:
- Any GL line cannot be mapped to both GAAP & Cash-Flow buckets.  
- Beginning BS is unbalanced.  
- AP/AR grid cannot be parsed into at least *date / description / amount / DCFlag*.

All monetary values are **USD**; multi-currency logic deferred to v1.
