• Merge BS opening balances + mappings + cash grid to produce a 17-column Journal (USD).
• On any fatal issue emit core.errors.report() with keys {file,row,issue,hint}.
• Tech stack is Python 3.12, pandas, pydantic, openpyxl.
• Currency is hard-coded to USD in v0.
• Exactly 13 weeks of projected entries.

When writing code, respect the active .cursor/config.yaml and all auto-attached rule files.
